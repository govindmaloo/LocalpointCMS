<p>After a few idyllic days in Gstaad, strolling down a New York City
street feels like being on an alien planet. A busy city feels jarring,
frightening even, because people often look crazy. Hurried creatures with
bulging eyes and gruff attitudes—life forms that are a far cry from those here
in Saanenland—populate the streets.</p>
<p>At least passing strangers in Gstaad nod or offer up a “Grüezi” along
the Wanderweg. In New York, if you dare say hello to a passerby or look them in
the eye, you are likely to be ignored if not called a weirdo or flipped off.</p>
<p>What is it about big towns that cause people to be so tough and gruff?
Perhaps it is because cities are an assault on the senses. Maybe someone had
New York in mind when they coined the term “sensory overload.” With all the
stimuli in a bustling city, it is no wonder people appear defensive. So much
visual and auditory aggression would make any normal person fearful. I find it
difficult to manage the number of people encroaching on my personal space,
which makes me more likely to look and act cold or angry.</p>
<p>But a city’s anonymity can also be a relief from small-town life, where
everyone knows everyone else’s business. Sometimes it’s nice to walk among
strangers who don’t know or care what you get up to late at night. But the same
anonymity can be isolating. Feeling lonely in a place packed with people is
arguably the worst kind of solitude.</p>
<p>Between the sensory assault and the anonymity, it is a surprise that so
many people live in cities. Choosing between the country and the city is not
easy for many people. Cities offer so much more than rural areas in the way of
work, culture, and inspiration, but they provide none of the countryside’s
peace and natural beauty.</p>
<p>How can one possibly have the best of both? How can one preserve village
life’s pleasantries while still drawing in the dynamism the world has to offer?
Gstaad is at a critical moment with regard to this question. Drawing a balance
between its expansion and preservation will mean everything for the region’s
future.</p>
<p>I would hate to see Gstaad turn into St. Moritz or Verbier. Granted, the
quality of the skiing is vastly different and so the region’s expansion will be
limited in this respect. But the real danger is greed. Too many new hotels,
community resources, and luxury shops will eventually destroy our adopted
alpine village’s idyllic charm.</p>
<p>Growth may be necessary, but it is not always paramount. Since there are
so many cities and glamorous resorts offering high-end luxury, why not
cultivate a little diversity here in Gstaad? Do we really need another designer
dress shop or hotel? Are more vulgar rich people who throw garish parties and
drive around in obnoxious cars really the demographic this town seeks? I hope
not.</p>
<p>Gstaad has always been the alternative to St. Moritz—the smaller,
quieter, and more demure sister to the glitzier, grander Engadine town. I want
it to stay this way. I don’t object to a little decadence, but when people
start flying in exotic shellfish by private jet and throwing lavish parties for
no particular reason, I begin to wonder what has happened to Gstaad. When I see
more women in head-to-toe fur and suitcase-sized crocodile Birkin bags at the
Eagle Club than actual skiers, I wonder if I am the only one who actually
enjoys Gstaad for the view and fresh mountain air.</p>
<p>Surely a balance can be reached where the need for growth and the desire
for comfort and luxury can be met without turning Gstaad into Beverly Hills.
Rich foreigners as well as Swiss property developers and business owners might
consider what drew people here in the first place before they shut down another
local business to open one that will bring in the big bucks and more ghastly
people driving Porsche Cayennes.</p>
<p>We come here to get away from the highfalutin city life. Is that so hard
to understand?</p>

down to Les Trois Pommes and buy myself a new Prada dress!</p>";}s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:17:"GstaadLife Editor";}s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Mon, 03 Dec 2012 11:43:56 +0100";s:7:"summary";s:578:"By Mandolyna Theodoracopulos After a few idyllic days in Gstaad, strolling down a New York City street feels like being on an alien planet.

Appeals against the Institute Le Rosey’s building project no.&#0160;75,
“Erli” and “Ausbau Hubelstrasse” were submitted within the deadline.&#0160;According
to the principal, Phillip Gudin, Institute Le Rosey aims to move from Gstaad to
a new campus in Schönried. In 2009, the board of trustees of Ferienheim
Fraubrunnen approved the sale of&#0160;Erli,
a 40,000 m² plot, to Le Rosey but the sale is only legally valid with planning
permission.&#0160;The
project plans for “Erli” and “Ausbau Hubelstrasse” were published between
September 12 and October 12, 2012. According to Armando Chissalé, Director of
Operations, 28 appeals were submitted during this time - ten against “Erli” and
18 against “Hubelstrasse”. However he would not yet comment on the specific
content of the appeals.</p>

health services for locals and visitors. The main focus was on two different
concepts: firstly, offers from external service providers and secondly, a
sustainable and innovative concept by the GPs of Saanenland. The external
providers mainly offered private medical institutions on the premises of the
hospital in Saanen. Apart from the uncertainty of such an option, such
institutions could endanger the existence of the hospital Saanen. This is why
the municipal council was convinced by the Saanenland GPs’ concept and has
handed over the implementation to them. The municipal council is persuaded that
the planned, coordinated and efficient cooperation of the GPs, the hospital in
