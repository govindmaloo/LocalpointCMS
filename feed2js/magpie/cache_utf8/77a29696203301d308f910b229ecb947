Photo: Diana Oehrli</td></tr></tbody></table>One of the many river sources of the Rhine is located just nine kilometers from my house. It blows my mind to think that waters originating here in my backyard travel through Europe and end up in the North Sea.<br /><br />And it's gotten me thinking that my move to the Alps can be likened to a return to the source,&nbsp;my early childhood place. And low and behold, I just read that life can be compared to a river, and that it, too, can be divided into three parts:<br /><br />• the source is our <b>past</b><br />• the channel is our <b>present</b><br />• the mouth is our<b>  future</b><br /><ol></ol>But these parts can only be divided conceptually, because they must remain in balance.<br /><br />When I find myself thinking that my life was  better in the 'old days', I become blind to the reality of the  present. Have I fully understood how the past has affected me? With the right tools and introspection, I learn what the root causes are for my distorted thinking, my fears, and my need for instant gratification and control. Instead, <b>by validating my past,</b> I am free to heal old wounds, and thereby, avoid repeating the same mistakes and behaviors. <br /><br />I must also <b>face the present,</b> which flows like the uninterrupted current of a river. We just can't stop that clock! And living in the present can be as peaceful as it can be exciting, (my recent skiing experiences in powder snow could be an example). But I must be careful. When I live only for the present, I find that I have little  regard for either precedent or consequence. How often have I agreed to do something without really thinking about how this action might fit into my schedule, and then later, to my horror realized that I didn't really have the time for it? The consequence was stress, breaking a promise, or losing credibility. Or, how about the times I said "yes"--when I really meant "no"--forgetting the bad thing that happened the last time I said "yes."<br /><br />And finally, I must <b>plan for my future.</b> There is nothing more satisfying than to plant the seeds for those trees that will bear fruits later. However, I can't just live for the future. When I live only for  some deferred reward, I strain myself too much, denying myself rich and satisfying experiences. And this could lead to burnout and hurt relationships. There needs to be a balance. It's okay to devote some energy each day to building the future, but not at the expense of the present.<br /><br /><i>Just as a river can be said to have parts that cannot be  clearly divided, so too should we consider the whole of our time when  deciding how to spend our lives.</i><br />-Deng Ming-Dao<br /><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b>More on one of the headwaters of the Rhine River</b><br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">This particular headwater is located at 2,252 meters above sea-level at the Sanetsch.

This is a time when they make their best cheese. The families live in huts using wood fires for warmth, and candles for light, as most do not have electricity (unless it's milking time, then the generators come on). This is a world far away from XBoxes, computers and other technological devices. This is a world where children have to rely on their imaginations for fun.<br /><br />I like living close to nature and in communion with people whose lives are--for the most part--absorbed in in the evolution of life without hesitation or contradiction. Here, there is no alienation. Everything belongs. Everything is as it should be.<br /><br />People often ask me why I've chosen to live alone in such a remote area. They ask me, don't you get stir-crazy? Don't you need shopping, cultural events, and people?<br /><br />Yes, I admit. Sometimes it's fun to leave the mountains, view an exhibition or concert, wander busy streets, sip coffee in cafés, check out the latest trends and fashions, feel the excitement in the cacophony of traffic and voices.<br /><br />Yet, for most of my daily living, there is nothing more soothing than living in a place where full moons are so evident that you can't help but pause to admire their roundness, their brightness, and the light they cast on ridges and slopes; or a place where stars twinkle above, their splendor still unmarred by light pollution. How about those sunsets and sunrises? No drama on stage can compare to a morning light illuminating the top of a mountain in a surreal glow. Then, there are the snowstorms that remind us of our vulnerability; and the droughts that remind us to conserve water; and the rain storms that replenish our aquifers and remind us to be grateful.<br /><br />I find that being integrated into the constant flow of nature helps me to let go, to enter freely into its process, and become absorbed by it. Life becomes evident.&nbsp;Even as I've yearned for love, companionship, understanding, and fellowship, there have been times when I've pushed it all away with petty emotions, plans, and constant questioning. I've let hatred or pride cloud my perceptions, and in doing so, I've hurt myself.<br /><br />So, as I let myself go, entering freely into the process of nature, I feel myself becoming absorbed by it. By integrating myself in that process, I find success. Then the sequence of things becomes as evident as the coming of the sun and moon, and everything is as it should be.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-3989546829238194208?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:165:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/3989546829238194208/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2012/01/everything-is-as-it-should-be.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/3989546829238194208";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/3989546829238194208";s:4:"link";s:76:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2012/01/everything-is-as-it-should-be.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"2";}}i:5;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-6113940795499465648";s:9:"published";s:29:"2012-01-10T09:52:00.001+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-01-11T21:07:47.251+01:00";s:5:"title";s:16:"Snow and silence";s:12:"atom_content";s:2765:"<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1k7s25IAlzg/Twv6hLhdfBI/AAAAAAAAAQs/PVFrbii9dUM/s1600/DSC01514.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1k7s25IAlzg/Twv6hLhdfBI/AAAAAAAAAQs/PVFrbii9dUM/s400/DSC01514.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Photo: Isabella Kiker</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal;">Happy New Year dear reader! I wish you much health, balance, and satisfaction in 2012!<br /><br />For those of you wondering what it's been like in the Alps, well, it's been snowing. Starting on the 19th of December, the white crystals began falling and they have continued doing so since. This amount of snowfall reminds me of childhood winters in the 70’s and 80’s, when I used to come visit my grandparents. In those days, chalet roofs were adorned with icicles and covered in thick white puffy layers; creeks and streams were hidden, their icy clear waters gurgling under open patches; and streets and paths were all white, their existence carved out of the landscape like mazes in snowy fields. How the snow crunched under foot! Ah! So great, a real winter again!<br /><br />The best thing about a snowy landscape is the silence. The sound of cars, trains, and people are dampened, their noise disappearing into nothingness. (This phenomenon, by the way dear reader, can be very dangerous when crossing a train track. One has trouble hearing the train coming.)<br /><br />A snowy landscape is wonderful for getting into the moment and for releasing worry and fear. I don't know about you, but when I succumb to worry, I am unable to get things done. I get stuck in the "what if" and "should haves." With a snowy landscape one doesn't need to shut out noise.

Losing the most votes was the SVP&nbsp;or Swiss People's Party, this country's right wing party best known for spreading xenophobia through its provocative posters. Remember the three white sheep kicking one black one out? (see below)<br /><br />Upon reading the voting results, I sighed in relief for my American half and for my foreign friends. Perhaps, the strong Swiss Franc cannot be blamed entirely for the drop in occupancy rates in area hotels.<br /><br />I have often thought that Switzerland was a land of contradictions. For example, our municipality nearly always votes SVP. But, I've noticed a rash of rich foreigners buying property in our area. How can a region sell property to foreigners and grant them large tax breaks&nbsp;while voting to stop immigration?&nbsp;Money? No!

As it turned out, I didn't get much purchasing done, as I ended up checking out a few churches and walking through the old town. Love that such history and culture is just an hour from home!<br /><br />If you ever make it to Bern, go to the <b>Münster</b>. It's a large Gothic cathedral in the old town, dating back to 1421. (Interestingly, a small romanesque chapel existed there as early as 1191 during the founding of Bern.)<br /><br />My legs were too sore from yesterday's training to go up the Münster's tower which is 100 meters tall. Apparently, it's the tallest cathedral in Switzerland. I did, however, enjoy looking at the Last Judgment sculpture above the main portal. As it turns out, it represents one of the most complete Late Gothic sculpture collections in Europe, and it is the only sculpture in Münster to survive the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation. &nbsp;I had never heard of him, but the artist was Erhard Küng from Wesphalia.&nbsp;It totally reminded me of Hieronymous Bosch's "Last Judgement."<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yw_Se7dnvv4/TqnFNA7LqzI/AAAAAAAAAO4/y7rmXt9-ZSc/s1600/Last_Judgement.mini.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="282" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yw_Se7dnvv4/TqnFNA7LqzI/AAAAAAAAAO4/y7rmXt9-ZSc/s400/Last_Judgement.mini.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Hioronymus Bosch's Last Judgement.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-3070290269918514583?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:173:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/3070290269918514583/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/carvings-above-entrance-to-munster-of.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/3070290269918514583";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/3070290269918514583";s:4:"link";s:84:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/carvings-above-entrance-to-munster-of.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"1";}}i:9;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-7216928231258749131";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-10-26T15:05:00.004+02:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-11-03T14:04:55.785+01:00";s:5:"title";s:26:"At the grocery store today";s:12:"atom_content";s:2541:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-imHiQ0v0obU/TqgBDm30iLI/AAAAAAAAAOo/dENROcVoeos/s1600/71155_14284074148_4120024_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-imHiQ0v0obU/TqgBDm30iLI/AAAAAAAAAOo/dENROcVoeos/s1600/71155_14284074148_4120024_n.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />While rushing to check out at our local Coop grocery store this morning, I found myself in line behind a woman arguing for a refund in broken French. I slowly emptied my cart of its  contents--amazingly fresh organic vegetables and fruits--onto the  conveyor belt and listened.<br /><br />The woman explained in broken French that she had purchased six yogurts, and six yogurts only, and she felt she should be paid out SFR 80. The checkout girl, who was obviously Swiss German speaking,&nbsp; nodded her head, filled out a yellow slip, and answered the woman in even worse French.<br /><br />One thing was for sure. This discussion was not going to end soon, and as I glanced at my watch, I realized I would be late for my appointment.&nbsp;So, I placed my produce back into the cart and stomped over to the next lane, uttering complaints under my breath. When I spotted a neighbor in line, I said something about continuing to shop at competing grocery store Migros, which has a customer service desk. While unloading my cart yet again, I peered over to the next lane and felt smug. The two women were still talking.<br /><br />It's true. Migros has a "Kundendienst" or a customer service desk that deals with  complicated matters such as refunds. This avoids customers having to wait in line too long. These desks also sell taxed garbage bags, household appliances,  printer cartridges and electronics. Coop also has a similar desk, but it is a high-volume sales kiosk, selling alcohol and cigarettes. I heard from a friend that Migros won't sell alcohol and cigarettes in its stores for ethical reasons.<br /><br />Competing grocery stores Coop and Migros account for about 70 percent of the market share for food and drinks in Switzerland. A little online research showed that Migros had better customer service, but Coop had better produce, especially organic selections. So there we have it... exactly my experience today.<br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-7216928231258749131?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:158:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/7216928231258749131/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/at-grocery-store-today.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/7216928231258749131";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/7216928231258749131";s:4:"link";s:69:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/at-grocery-store-today.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"2";}}i:10;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-4242035802370529779";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-10-25T11:09:00.003+02:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-10-25T11:37:28.174+02:00";s:5:"title";s:38:"Open-air museum closes for winter soon";s:12:"atom_content";s:8843:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F1N59eYF98s/TqZzU7fvf-I/AAAAAAAAANQ/iOZ914e8a9w/s1600/DSC01428.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-F1N59eYF98s/TqZzU7fvf-I/AAAAAAAAANQ/iOZ914e8a9w/s400/DSC01428.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">To be seen in  Ballenberg: A typical Bernese Oberland chalet built in the 17th century.

I like the Alps for their beauty and peacefulness but dislike the isolation I feel there at times. <br /><br />A few days ago, the children's fall school holiday began. So, we hopped in the car and drove south. Six-and-a-half hours later, we arrived in the Principality of Monaco. Upon our mid-afternoon departure, air temperatures had hovered in the single digits; and when we arrived at our destination near midnight, we rejoiced at feeling 18 degrees.<br /><br />During out stay in newly married Prince Albert's land, I was struck by more than just balmy temperatures. While enjoying a black coffee and writing post cards under the arches of the Place d'Armes, I sat back and observed the scene around me.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1JQjEUelcPw/TqJ0qQ-9F5I/AAAAAAAAANI/NXRDmDx1EUw/s1600/2011-10-16T09-16-47.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1JQjEUelcPw/TqJ0qQ-9F5I/AAAAAAAAANI/NXRDmDx1EUw/s200/2011-10-16T09-16-47.jpeg" width="200" /></a>It was Sunday, yet a produce market was in full swing. Stylish women wearing sunglasses and carrying wicker baskets picked up and sniffed red peppers; salespeople argued loudly about politics; children played at a nearby playground while their care-keepers chatted.<br /><br />My eye stopped on a bevy of smartly coiffed women at a nearby table. They spoke in fast French, chain smoked, and drank a cloudy beverage that was most likely Pastis. They gestured and laughed in a way I  have never seen women do back in Switzerland. That they seemed at ease, as if socializing in their own living rooms, drew me to the conclusion that they were locals. <br /><br />I have yet to witness such a produce market in our village on a Sunday, as the Swiss reserve this holy day for church and for family.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-4134474253436292229?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:167:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/4134474253436292229/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/finding-warmth-out-of-mountains.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/4134474253436292229";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/4134474253436292229";s:4:"link";s:78:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/finding-warmth-out-of-mountains.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"0";}}i:13;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-3075826960688945291";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-10-11T14:15:00.005+02:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-10-22T09:01:47.969+02:00";s:5:"title";s:22:"First hike of the year";s:12:"atom_content";s:4521:"<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U-Hz17OG9UY/TpQnxOX-OFI/AAAAAAAAAMg/xU43fzWG13o/s1600/photo+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U-Hz17OG9UY/TpQnxOX-OFI/AAAAAAAAAMg/xU43fzWG13o/s400/photo+3.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Final third stage of the hike.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A few weeks ago, I over-exerted myself by going on a hike from Reusch (1,350) to Scex Rouge (2,971m), the last part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQlXtIkKrDQ&amp;feature=related">Glacier 3000 Run</a>&nbsp;course. It may have been an unwise idea for me to attempt 1,621 vertical meters for my first hike of the year.<br /><br />The two&nbsp;girlfriends who had invited me, had--unbeknownst to me--been going on weekly hikes since April, one of them actually participating in the Glacier 3000 Run. I figured if people can run up that mountain, I could certainly walk it. I had been running five to six miles on the flat four times a week all summer.<br /><br />So upon their advice, I purchased expensive walking sticks. Later I would be glad I had them. Our planned Tuesday hike was delayed because of fresh fallen snow. We let a few days pass, and then Thursday evening, we decided to go the next day. I&nbsp;packed a small rucksack with a bottle of water, a spare shirt and sweater, some almonds, and a hat. I decided to leave the dog at home. I had a feeling he might be too much of a distraction for me if I experienced vertigo during the steep parts.<br /><br />During the first third of the hike, the three of us chatted our way up to the Oldenegg, where the path narrowed and steepened. Walking through&nbsp;Martinställi, I noticed that I had trouble keeping up with my two friends. I kept them in sight, but knew that my heart rate was in anaerobic territory.<br /><br />At one point, just below the Cabane (or middle station), I got off track and tried to head straight up to the station itself, instead of keeping left and heading towards the old Cabane. I found myself in the middle of sliding rock shale, unable to go up or down. As I started to retrace my steps, my cell phone rang, but I couldn't answer it, as I was too busy keeping my balance on the slippery shale. Eventually, I met up with my colleagues who appeared worried and cold from waiting. I felt guilty and decided to forgo drinking water or eating a snack. A big mistake. We immediately started on the final third part of the hike (see picture above).<br /><br />On this treacherous ice-encrusted path, my colleagues stayed near me, encouraging me the whole way. They knew about my vertigo problem and they kept me distracted with instructions on how and where to plant my poles and my feet. By the time, we got to the top, we were in 50 centimeters of hard snow, and I was exhausted.<br /><br />As we arrived at the bottom of the little Scex Rouge chairlift (near the top), one girlfriend asked if I wanted to take the lift. I refused. I had made it all this way and wasn't going to cop-out now. A stranger near the top asked me if I was okay. I said, "yes, of course." I must have been swaying.<br /><br />We had a lovely lunch of soup and bread on the deck overlooking the glacier. I felt nauseous. So,&nbsp;I tried to drink as much water as I could.&nbsp;Then, to my relief, we took the lift down. I sat the whole way. &nbsp;The rest of the day, I felt a bit spaced-out. Nevertheless, I was able to participate in karate class later that evening and did not have muscle soreness the next day.<br /><br />I know I overdid it. But I feel&nbsp;proud for making it to the top and for pushing through my limits. Two days later, I went on a six mile jog including a run up the mountain to my home, and it was easier than I thought. Since then, I've gone on two more (less adventuresome) hikes with one of the&nbsp; mountain goat girlfriends. I've discovered one of her secrets; she eats dried figs along the way. I'm a very lucky girl to have friends like her and to live so close to so much hiking!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-3075826960688945291?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:154:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/3075826960688945291/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/first-hike-of-year.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/3075826960688945291";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/3075826960688945291";s:4:"link";s:65:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/first-hike-of-year.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"0";}}i:14;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-5463130040829780972";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-10-01T18:43:00.000+02:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-10-21T18:50:40.729+02:00";s:5:"title";s:19:"A land of contrasts";s:12:"atom_content";s:1419:"<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpiA9gwFt8A/TqGej8pIeYI/AAAAAAAAAM4/r9PLZ4BqfFE/s1600/2011-09-24T11-37-38.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MpiA9gwFt8A/TqGej8pIeYI/AAAAAAAAAM4/r9PLZ4BqfFE/s400/2011-09-24T11-37-38.jpeg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Only in Europe...</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In the USA, the word "F*@ck" is generally considered obscene and reserved for rated R or PG-13 movies. In Switzerland, where there seem to be rules for everything, no rules seem to exist that would prevent the commercial use of such a word. And in our neck of the woods, the word seems to pass our local skate park propriety test. We thought the band's name was well-paired with the noise emanating from the van's speaker system, sounds which our tender ears found quite jarring. Perhaps, we're simply getting outdated... although my children thankfully agreed with me. <br /><br /><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-5463130040829780972?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:150:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/5463130040829780972/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/only-in-europe.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/5463130040829780972";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/5463130040829780972";s:4:"link";s:61:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/10/only-in-europe.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"0";}}i:15;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-9160315858119455463";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-09-19T13:20:00.000+02:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-09-19T13:20:35.541+02:00";s:5:"title";s:12:"Back in town";s:12:"atom_content";s:1705:"We're back in the Swiss Alps, and I'm ready to write again. Thank you, dear readers for lamenting my absence and for motivating me to get back to writing.<br /><br />Since our return from the U.S.A., temperatures have been warm, hovering in the mid to high 20's Celsius. We've enjoyed wearing T-shirts and shorts and not having to turn on the heat.&nbsp;Locals tell me that while we were away, it rained incessantly and was quite cold. Although they unfortunately&nbsp;didn't have much of a summer, the rain refilled water reservoirs and brought ground water levels back to normal.&nbsp;Yesterday, the weather started changing and the temperatures became more fall-like. I look forward to the disappearance of fruit flies.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Neighborhood children have been setting traps for field mice that have been making mounds of dirt in the meadows.

While I rejoiced, my smoker friends grumbled, predicting the end of pub socializing. How I argued with them!<br /><br />As they say, “there's nothing worse than a reformed smoker!” But I'm not as extreme as my friend Chantal. She can’t stand cigarette smoke, even outside.<br /><br />Chantal is the author of <i>One Big Yodel, </i>one of my favorite expat blogs in Switzerland. Check out her informative and funny post "<a href="http://www.onebigyodel.com/2011/03/lunch-al-fresco-if-you-can.html">Lunch al fresco (if you can)</a>" on the smoking topic. A Chicago native and current resident of Baden, Switzerland, Chantal received the Rosalie Fleming Memorial Humor Prize for her satire on the airline industry last year. <br /><br />Chantal’s post reminded me of a New Yorker's experience following the smoking ban in his city. As he sat in a cab with an Italian visitor, they spotted a crowd of smokers gathered on the sidewalk in the financial district.<br /><br />“You have a lot of beautiful and conservatively dressed street ladies here,” the Italian said.<br /><br />“Huh?” <br /><br />“At home in Italy, only prostitutes smoke in the streets.”<br /><br />Outdoor smoke doesn’t bother me so much. If people want to smoke outdoors, I don't mind. But smoking in tight spaces is sickening, especially in cable cars or trains, as was allowed before 2005 when the Swiss banned smoking on public transportation. Don’t you remember the days when we had to squeeze our bodies into crowded non-smoking train cars, while the adjoining smoking car was empty?<br /><br />Smoking remains a problem in Switzerland with 30% of the Swiss population still smoking (nearly 40% in the 20 to 24 year old category).<br /><br />What do you think about smoking outdoors?

It usually takes an outsider to remind me how lucky we are to be living in a country with functional public transportation.<br /><br />During breakfast this morning, a visiting American friend voiced his  amazement at the efficiency of Swiss rail. Not only did he laud Swiss  rail's online timetable, he couldn't believe it actually indicated the  arrival and departure platforms ahead of time. During his trip from  Basel to Gstaad, he had been worried about the short four-minute layover in  Bern. When the time came to switch trains, he easily found his  connecting train, thanks to presence of large platform numbers and destination  signs. For those of you who don't already use it, click <a href="http://fahrplan.sbb.ch/bin/query.exe/en?">here</a> to access Swiss rail's super efficient timetable.<br /><br />On a related note... <br /><br />I read in the newspaper this past Friday that Switzerland's Transportation Minister Doris Leuthard had unveiled a proposal to increase the price of the annual highway vehicle sticker from the current 40 francs to 100 francs. Rail fares would rise by 10 percent. Leuthard said these increases were necessary to pay for railway infrastructure. These increases are planned for 2015 and are subject to a national referendum.<br /><br />I love it! Motorists are to subsidize rail! Of course, Switzerland's right wing parties are squawking. <br /><br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-swFJme_RIkc/TZi6ledbM4I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/JBqRGEUTA7M/s1600/sbb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="215" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-swFJme_RIkc/TZi6ledbM4I/AAAAAAAAAMQ/JBqRGEUTA7M/s400/sbb.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Swiss Rail's online timetable</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-8324028375947674684?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:175:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/8324028375947674684/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/04/swiss-rail-worth-higher-highway-sticker.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/8324028375947674684";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/8324028375947674684";s:4:"link";s:86:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/04/swiss-rail-worth-higher-highway-sticker.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"2";}}i:18;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:69:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-639690413977736245";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-03-22T11:45:00.052+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-04-04T21:05:48.796+02:00";s:5:"title";s:40:"A moonlit carriage ride and slowing down";s:12:"atom_content";s:4722:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nj0iRJifdCE/TYhnyAAJ0pI/AAAAAAAAALY/VA1IrMdfSBU/s1600/themoon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nj0iRJifdCE/TYhnyAAJ0pI/AAAAAAAAALY/VA1IrMdfSBU/s400/themoon.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />The other night, I went to a birthday party that ended with a horse-drawn carriage ride under a full moon. Despite freezing temperatures, my children, our little dog,  and I felt warm under doubled over wool blankets. The clip-clop of horse hooves and the crisp night air lulled me into relaxation.<br /><br />Out the back of our covered wagon, I watched the moonlit, mountainous landscape pass by, noticing every roadside tree, rock, and snow measuring stick.<br /><br />Soon, the three-year old child sitting opposite me, fell asleep, her little body nestled at her father's side. As we moved through the wild, mostly uninhabited region behind Lauenen, I thought of my grandfather who had grown up there. I remembered the stories he had told me, including his witnessing the first motorcar to roll into the village. My grandfather died at 95, never driving a car. Yes, he walked a lot.<br /><br />This carriage ride has prompted me to share a blog with you that I have been following for the past few years. It focuses on some of the same lifestyle values that the older generation of Swiss alpine folk hold dear, such as simplicity, health, frugality, family life, and living in the moment.<br /><br />It is called <i>Zen Habits</i>, and it's one of the most read blogs on the internet.<br /><br />I found <i>Zen Habits </i> after googling "organize my life." It appealed to me because of its simple all-white large-font design and for its clear concise writing. I liked the blog's tag-line: "Smile, breathe &amp; go slowly." Come to think of it... it sounds a bit like Gstaad's tourism slogan  "Come up, slow down." <br /><br />Reading his articles leaves me calmer and more relaxed than before. My motivation and productivity has also increased after reading posts on getting things done, how to become an early riser, and how to start a project.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_ijBmU5E1o8/TYh6-7oIc0I/AAAAAAAAALc/jWMCI2kM99Y/s1600/leo-babauta.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_ijBmU5E1o8/TYh6-7oIc0I/AAAAAAAAALc/jWMCI2kM99Y/s200/leo-babauta.jpg" width="142" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Leo Babauta, author of <br /><i>Zen Habits</i></td></tr></tbody></table>So, who's this Leo Babauta? In his bio, he writes: "I am is a regular guy, a father of six kids, a husband, a writer." Not only is he a writer, he's a blogger and journalist from Guam who moved to San Francisco in 2010, three years after starting <i>Zen Habits</i> that now has more than 200,000 subscribers. Time Magazine named <i>Zen Habits</i> one of the Top Blogs of 2009.<br /><br />According to Wikepedia, Babauta's first print book <i>The Power of Less</i> reached the Amazon best-seller list on its first day on the market and remains a top-selling business motivation book.&nbsp; For more information on Leo Babauta and Zen Habits, click <a href="http://zenhabits.net/about/">here</a>. <br /><br />I like Babauta's humble, forgiving, and positive attitude. "I  have no claims to perfection," he writes. "I fail all the time, on a daily basis. But  I don’t let it stop me." He's not preachy.

We're down to 16C (60.8F) at night. My goal is 13C-14C (55.4-57.2F). The nuclear catastrophe in Japan is reminding me that although I am lucky to be living in a time and place of plenty, things might not always stay like that. <br /><br />Thriftiness doesn't have to mean inferior quality.&nbsp; On the contrary. How well I slept during my childhood holidays spent at my grandparents' chalet in the Swiss Alps! Under layers of thick cotton sheets, wool blankets, and a huge puffy down comforter, I roasted even though the room was frigid.

People who think they are luxuriating in 25C (77F) bedrooms are in fact ruining their health.<br /><br />Electricity is too cheap. We leave lights burning in rooms we don't use. We leave appliances on. We overheat rooms. We unnecessarily light facades of buildings, creating light pollution. <br /><br />My grandfather, who was an electrician, reprimanded me if I left lights burning in my room. He limited hot water use to the equivalent of three inches of lukewarm bathwater once a week. He shook his head and called us wasteful, when we asked for deeper, warmer, more frequent baths. So, my two brothers and I trudged over to the public swimming pool to shower every day. We were thrilled to find the "secret red button" in the garage turning on the water heater. <br /><br />My grandfather had lived through two world wars and two depressions. He grew up without electricity. As a child, he had hungered; he had scythed and raked hay for entire days under a blistering sun; he had shoveled manure and milked cows in the evenings after school; he had lost  brothers, sisters, and both parents due to poverty and disease. As a grown man, he had worked as a linesman during the day,  as a musician at night, and as a farmhand on weekends. I understand him. He had lived without so much we take for granted today. He had understood the value of energy. <br /><br />Following the Japanese earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor meltdown, the need to conserve energy is made even more clear than before.<br /><br />The true cost of nuclear power is <b>unaffordable</b> in both human and financial terms. Hopefully, politicians will discard the arguments of short-term profiteers who refuse to include the true cost of nuclear plant construction, safety precautions, waste storage, and plant  decommissioning in their energy calculations. <br /><br />I don't want to be wasteful. No do I want to look silly or frilly. So, I will persevere and find warm AND sexy pajamas. Then, I will sleep like a charm.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-1139956898940203430?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:167:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/1139956898940203430/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/03/help-i-cant-find-normal-pajamas.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/1139956898940203430";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/1139956898940203430";s:4:"link";s:78:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/03/help-i-cant-find-normal-pajamas.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"2";}}i:21;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-5087316817813560595";s:9:"published";s:29:"2011-02-01T13:16:00.017+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-04-04T13:37:11.265+02:00";s:5:"title";s:46:"It's never too late to learn rules of the road";s:12:"atom_content";s:4745:"<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TUf2VXZ8pWI/AAAAAAAAAKs/eM02d9ke8lY/s1600/driving.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TUf2VXZ8pWI/AAAAAAAAAKs/eM02d9ke8lY/s200/driving.jpg" width="200" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Driving in Switzerland <br />can be a challenge.</td></tr></tbody></table>I've had my driver's license since I was 16 years old. Granted, the test that I took in Middletown, Rhode Island, was easy. No highway driving and no parallel parking were required, (although I had practiced it with my instructor). All I was required to do was drive around the block, use my blinker and execute a three point turn. Voilà!<br /><br />The most valuable driving knowledge I have collected during the past 24 years, I've learned on the road.<br /><br />Like the day I drove a friend from Newport to Cape Cod and forgot to look over my shoulder to check the blind spot before passing a car on the highway. Thank goodness my friend yelped, as I could swerve back into my lane on time and avoid an accident.<br /><br />Or the four times, I lightly hit a car in a parking lot, because I misjudged the distances or forgot to use my mirrors.<br /><br />Or when I slid into a speeding car that was going uphill on an icy single lane road. I learned that even though the driver of that car was speeding, she had the right of way being the car going uphill, and I, being the car going downhill, must always have control over my vehicle no matter the condition of the road. <br /><br />So, after living in the Swiss Alps for the past nine years, I am still learning valuable information about driving, and especially about driving in Europe. And, now I know why I've had the following strange and unpleasant experiences at two intersections in my village:<br /><ol><li>near-collisions;</li><li>drivers honking at me;</li><li>drivers wildly gesturing with their mouths open;</li><li>my uttering of swearwords (out of earshot of those outside my car) at what I perceived to be the rudeness of other drivers.</li></ol><ol></ol>It was a good Swiss friend who educated me.<br /><br />It's called <b>priority to the right</b> or 'priorité à droite' in French. Here it is. If you are driving along in a village, anyone joining that road from your right hand side (even if they are on a small side road and you are on a major road) has priority over you. They don't have to stop, (as they do in the USA), you do... even if you are traveling at a good clip. This rule is valid unless otherwise indicated by a stop or yield sign. <br /><br />If in doubt, slow down, keep you eyes open and your foot near the brake, and be ready to be courteous (but don't expect any thanks)!<br /><br />Here are the two intersections in question:<br /><br />Intersection 1: <br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TUf3bjMZhuI/AAAAAAAAAK0/FeNW1SNYmMA/s1600/krambruck.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="221" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TUf3bjMZhuI/AAAAAAAAAK0/FeNW1SNYmMA/s320/krambruck.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />The red car has priority.

We could ski nearly every day of our two-week break. Since then, the weather has warmed up considerably, to the point that we have been sunbathing in T-shirts in front of the house.<br /><br />The sun has done wonders for our Vitamin D levels but wrecked havoc on the snow. Grey-green patches are now visible on many a southwest-facing slope. Some mountains have closed their lifts.<br /><br />With worried frowns on their faces, locals say in hushed voices: "This is April weather. It doesn't look good for the rest of ski season. We need more snow."<br /><br />With temperatures hovering around 10 C, it's even too warm for snow machines that work best when temperatures stay below -5 C. I don't like snow machines. They are ugly. They use too much electricity and water. Mostly, I don't like them because they are just band-aid solutions to the bigger problem, that the earth is warming up and that we are unwilling to reduce our use of gasoline and electricity.<br /><br />Sure, I felt the benefit of snow making while skiing over the holidays. Sections of slope that used to get scrapped up, icy, and bare, were well covered with artificial snow, making the the whole run much more enjoyable than before. Once back in my car, I was happy.<br /><br />"Ah, that was a good day skiing," I thought. Instead of having the following thought: "Yikes! That sucked! The base was too thin. We don't have enough snow. Perhaps, we should really DO something against global warming."<br /><br />Meanwhile, we read in the news that the USA has been slammed with yet another snow storm, bringing out the global warming naysayers. I have a theory.&nbsp; The USA, holder of the "World's Worst Polluter Award," has the strongest anti-environmental rhetoric, because it gets the coldest weather. You see, pollution emitted by the USA rises into the atmosphere and travels with the winds to Europe, where the glaciers are melting and the snow falls are diminishing.&nbsp; It's like living downstream from a polluter.<br /><br />On the other hand, the USA is experiencing meters of snow and cold weather. Americans don't feel the effects of global warming, explaining why they don't believe in climate change. So I will join my European friends in being angry at the USA for melting our glaciers and our snow; in the meantime, I'll work on my tan.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-6115595587778719882?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:160:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/6115595587778719882/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/01/my-global-warming-theory.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/6115595587778719882";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/6115595587778719882";s:4:"link";s:71:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2011/01/my-global-warming-theory.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"2";}}i:23;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-4199480597514471764";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-12-17T11:53:00.016+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-04-04T13:35:05.979+02:00";s:5:"title";s:26:"Hoping to de-stress Advent";s:12:"atom_content";s:3512:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TQswZtAWEwI/AAAAAAAAAKg/ih8Hnhcffl0/s1600/creche.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TQswZtAWEwI/AAAAAAAAAKg/ih8Hnhcffl0/s200/creche.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div>Each year by mid-November, moods change. The switch is clear and noticeable. My children come home from school and tell me about fights and bullying. They have trouble focusing on homework. They are on edge.<br /><br />I feel it too. Some  of my anxiety if  self-imposed, i.e. I <i>should</i> order the Christmas  cards; I <i>should</i> <b>make gifts</b>  with the children for relatives; I  <i>should</i> buy all the presents now; I <i>should</i>  wrap them all before  December. If my super-mom friends can do this, so can I!<br /><br />Mostly, the stress comes from the outside. Scheduling conflicts occur. People are moodier and lose  their tempers more easily than before. <br /><br />When I feel unhappy, I blame cold  weather, a sedentary lifestyle, and creeping weight gain. I&nbsp; conclude it must have something to do with Christmas, and I start to fantasize about leaving town for that forced holiday.<br /><br /><b>Boundaries are disappearing</b><br /><br />My friends in the construction trade work crazy hours in order to get chalets ready in time for Christmas. They work over lunch, evenings and weekends--yes, even Sundays--rarely seeing their spouses and children. Their bosses can't say "no" for fear of losing contracts. And those contracts are worth a lot of money in Gstaad, which is home to many of the world's billionaires. Known as <i>die gute Gäste, </i>these rich chalet owners have insatiable and exorbitant demands. And this trend is worsening. The worst are the newly rich, who seem drunk with their new wealth, unable to think of the human consequences of their demands.<br /><br />I understand  that people need money, but there are boundaries; and too much money makes us forget those limits. For example, the overworked husband, who doesn't see his family during Advent, and then, out of guilt, spends a month's salary on gifts, damages the family finances and spoils his children. Is this what he really wants?<br /><br /><b>Organizing Advent</b><br /><br />This year on November 28, my neighbors turned on their  outdoor light garlands. I was puzzled. Then,&nbsp; I googled "Advent" and learned that  November 28, 2010, was the the first of the four Sundays before December 25. I also learned that Advent (from the Latin word <i>adventus </i>meaning  "coming") is a time  of expectant <b>waiting and preparation... and of hope.</b><br /><br />Then, I had lightbulb moment.<br /><br />I realized that I will never be like one of my over-achieving friends. So to alleviate stress this year, I decided to split my to-do list into  four parts, corresponding to the four weeks of Advent. So far it is helping.<br /><br />Then, today, I read that Advent used to be a period of fasting starting  in the 4th-century. This fast began after St. Martin's feast (November  11) and lasted 40 days. Perhaps, this could be the answer to my weight woes?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-4199480597514471764?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:162:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/4199480597514471764/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2010/12/hoping-to-de-stress-advent.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/4199480597514471764";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/4199480597514471764";s:4:"link";s:73:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2010/12/hoping-to-de-stress-advent.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"1";}}i:24;a:13:{s:2:"id";s:70:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866.post-2851852123052238991";s:9:"published";s:29:"2010-12-15T08:46:00.024+01:00";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2011-04-05T20:59:33.888+02:00";s:5:"title";s:46:"5 painless green changes that are good for you";s:12:"atom_content";s:5501:"<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RRH0L4taptA/TZRJlWm_36I/AAAAAAAAAL8/g1FWhqDy0rM/s1600/ocean.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RRH0L4taptA/TZRJlWm_36I/AAAAAAAAAL8/g1FWhqDy0rM/s400/ocean.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;">Protecting clean water, air, and soil can be good for you too.</span></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_3cI0ciZBh4o/TQh4EAyEYoI/AAAAAAAAAKc/mNTg__C8JBs/s1600/americasailing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><br /></a><br /><br /><br />I touched a nerve.&nbsp; I had no idea that talking about "climate change" could make my friends become so... how can I say this...<b> emotional. </b><br /><br />A few days ago, I posted on Facebook that I had just watched Al Gore's  "Inconvenient Truth" and that I was ashamed the USA wasn't doing  more to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. Within one day, my post drew 13 reactions from both Switzerland and the USA. Opinions were mixed. Some got personal. <br /><br /><i><span data-jsid="text">"Diana, don't believe everything you see in a movie!  Climategate showed us something.  And the claims of that movie are well..."&nbsp; <span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;</span></span></i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i><span data-jsid="text"><span class="text_exposed_show">"If they [pro-oil lobbies and government officials] didn't have anything to hide, why would they have worked so hard to muddy the waters? Aren't their ridiculously vigorous denials and attacks proof perfect of their culpability?"</span>&nbsp;</span></i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i><span data-jsid="text">"Sorry, that film has been widely discredited. Al should have quit after he invented the Internet...</span> "</i><br /><br />On and on...<br /><br />I think fear is the culprit. Pro-business types get emotional because they are afraid of: not being able to jet off on vacation; not being able to drive and get everywhere fast (perhaps avoiding their true inner selves); of having to wear bulky, potentially unattractive clothes due to colder temperatures in their homes. Environmentalists get emotional because they are afraid that the health of future generations is at risk. So, let's break through the fear and do something positive for ourselves.<br /><br /><b>Five easy green changes to live like the Swiss alpine folk</b><br /><br />Living green doesn't have to be painful. The following five lifestyle changes could actually be good for you. I try to: <br /><ol><li> <b>walk </b>when I can. Walking burns calories. Your legs will gain muscle and definition. Your butt and thighs will get smaller. I meditate while I walk. Sometimes, I meet people and friends along the way. I get fresh air and sunlight on my face, helping with the 'winter blues.' Swiss alpine folk walked everywhere, and didn't seem to need anti-depressants.</li><li><b>lower the thermostat.</b> I try to keep my house at under 18C or 64F. Since I've done this, I haven't had one sinus infection and my skin seems smoother and less dry than before. I have to wear sweaters and long pants. So what? Swiss alpine folk didn't have fancy heating systems. They used wood stoves to heat their living room/kitchen areas. They slept in unheated spaces.</li><li><b>vacation at home.</b> For periods of less than two-weeks, I try to forgo long distance trips. My home is more comfortable than any five star hotel. There's no stress getting around. Think of all the fossil fuels you save! It  could be fun! Swiss alpine folk didn't travel much, being content to stay in their villages. They loved their homes, their landscape and took care of their surroundings. Why do you think the Swiss Alps are so beautiful? Farmers contribute to the beauty of the landscape by maintaining the land.&nbsp; </li><li><b>eat food in season.</b> I try to forgo buying foods that are out of season and that had to be flown in. Such produce tastes like cardboard and is much better fresh from the vine. I make exceptions for oranges, chocolate and coffee. Also, I sometimes can't wait to taste strawberries. So I will buy them earlier in Spring when they come from Spain. Swiss alpine folk didn't buy exotic foods. They were perfectly healthy eating canned vegetables, cheese, and vegetables grown in their gardens.</li><li><b>avoid plastic.</b> I try not to buy items made of plastic. Not only are they super ugly, they are made of oil. Plus, they can't be repaired as easily as things made of wood or metal. Swiss Alpine folk fixed everything. When they bought something, it was to last a lifetime. </li></ol>If the scientists in Gore's film are wrong, and man-made climate change  is a hoax, at least I am doing my little bit and not polluting the air,   water and land... and I am doing something for myself in the process.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6196532161474634866-2851852123052238991?l=www.lifeintheswissalps.com' alt='' /></div>";s:12:"link_replies";s:171:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/2851852123052238991/comments/defaulthttp://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2010/12/am-i-willing-to-sail-instead-of-fly.html#comment-form";s:9:"link_edit";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/2851852123052238991";s:9:"link_self";s:82:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default/2851852123052238991";s:4:"link";s:82:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/2010/12/am-i-willing-to-sail-instead-of-fly.html";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:3:"thr";a:1:{s:5:"total";s:1:"1";}}}s:7:"channel";a:13:{s:2:"id";s:45:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6196532161474634866";s:7:"updated";s:29:"2012-11-06T07:59:21.686+01:00";s:5:"title";s:22:"Life in the Swiss Alps";s:42:"link_http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#feed";s:53:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/feeds/posts/default";s:9:"link_self";s:62:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default";s:4:"link";s:34:"http://www.lifeintheswissalps.com/";s:8:"link_hub";s:32:"http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/";s:9:"link_next";s:92:"http://www.blogger.com/feeds/6196532161474634866/posts/default?start-index=26&max-results=25";s:11:"author_name";s:5:"Diana";s:10:"author_uri";s:51:"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16193399176964064345";s:12:"author_email";s:19:"noreply@blogger.com";s:9:"generator";s:7:"Blogger";s:10:"opensearch";a:3:{s:12:"totalresults";s:2:"46";s:10:"startindex";s:1:"1";s:12:"itemsperpage";s:2:"25";}}s:9:"textinput";a:0:{}s:5:"image";a:0:{}s:9:"feed_type";s:4:"Atom";s:12:"feed_version";N;s:8:"encoding";s:5:"UTF-8";s:16:"_source_encoding";s:0:"";s:5:"ERROR";s:0:"";s:7:"WARNING";s:0:"";s:19:"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS";a:6:{i:0;s:7:"content";i:1;s:7:"summary";i:2;s:4:"info";i:3;s:5:"title";i:4;s:7:"tagline";i:5;s:9:"copyright";}s:16:"_KNOWN_ENCODINGS";a:3:{i:0;s:5:"UTF-8";i:1;s:8:"US-ASCII";i:2;s:10:"ISO-8859-1";}s:5:"stack";a:0:{}s:9:"inchannel";b:0;s:6:"initem";b:0;s:9:"incontent";b:0;s:11:"intextinput";b:0;s:7:"inimage";b:0;s:17:"current_namespace";b:0;s:13:"last_modified";s:31:"Tue, 06 Nov 2012 06:59:21 GMT
