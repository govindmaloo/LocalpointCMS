<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/lAuRvIzwuDqHGXCyfa5cteFGh6c/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/lAuRvIzwuDqHGXCyfa5cteFGh6c/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a></p><p>In <a title="Web Application Performance Testing Using WAPT" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/web-application-load-stress-and-performance-testing-using-wapt/">previous article</a> we discussed on how WAPT pro <strong>performance testing tool</strong> can be used for website performance testing. But if you want to generate much higher load on web site you must use the latest x64 Load Engine release from WAPT team. This article and ultimately the testing tool is very useful for performance testers.</p>
<p>This is in fact most crucial test for time critical applications such as stock management systems which gets refreshed every minute creating huge load on <span id="more-918"></span>web site as there are thousands of users accessing the web site at the same moment.</p>
<p>For such applications stress testing with more than 10,000 users is a basic test. The WAPT Pro comes with default &#8220;Load Agents&#8221; functionality to test average load on any web site. But for high capacity test with more than 10,000 users we can now leverage the power of x64 Load Engine extension.</p>
<p>x64 Load Engine is similar to Load Agents feature on WAPT Pro installation. The main difference is in the ability of load engine to generate huge load using 64 bit Windows systems. Using one 64 bit server you can dramatically increase the load testing capacity on web site under test. The x64 Load Engine can be configured in such a way that using slightly high end hardware you can easily generate more than 100k virtual users load on web site.</p>
<p>Assume that you want to stress test your web site with 100,000 concurrent virtual users. You can achieve this using 4 servers each with 25,000 virtual users. Setup this load engine on 4 systems and use them concurrently to achieve desired web site load. This powerful x64 Load Engine effectively utilizes the available memory resources on 64 bit system architecture.</p>
<p><strong>WAPT Pro x64 Load Engine Installation:</strong><br />
- You can install x64 Load Engine on 64 bit version of Windows XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7 OS.<br />
- x64 Load engine works best on following hardware configuration:<br />
Core i5/Phenom or CPU better than this, 8+ GB RAM and Gigabit Ethernet</p>
<p><strong>How to install:    </strong><br />
x64 Load Engine is a WAPT Pro extension so it runs on WAPT Pro tool similar to Load Agents. To use this load engine you must have WAPT Pro installed first. You can download and install x64 Load Engine from below mentioned link. After installation you can start using load engine using the WAPT pro workplace itself.<br />
<a title="Download WAPT Pro x64 load Engine" href="http://www.loadtestingtool.com/x64-load-engine.shtml" target="_blank">Download WAPT Pro x64 Engine</a>.</p>
<p><strong>x64 Load Engine Pros:</strong><br />
- You can generate almost unlimited virtual users (test load) on Windows 64 system.<br />
- Easy to install, learn and configure<br />
Check out below screenshot to know the simplicity of x64 Load Engine Manager:<br />

- No restrictions on the size of used virtual memory</p>
<p><strong>x64 Load Engine Cons:</strong><br />
- No evaluation period available<br />
- Works with WAPT Pro only</p>
<p>As said earlier in my comment, this tool is very useful for <a title="Performance testing, load testing and stress testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-performance-testing-load-testing-stress-testing/"><strong>performance, stress &amp; load testers</strong></a>. Other testers can get a glimpse of the performance testing scope which is very interesting to work on!</p>

<strong><a title="What is LoadUI" href="http://loadui.org/About-loadUI/what-is-loadui.html" target="_blank">LoadUI</a> is a free and open source load testing tool that allows you to do complex load tests and test the performance by simply dragging the different components around. </strong>LoadUI lets you to create and update test cases while you run them. What is making loadUI powerful is the focus on usability through its visual interface and intuitive design combined with the flexibility that comes from the possibility of making changes during the test.</p>
<h3>How loadUI works:</h3>
<p>LoadUI consist of building blocks called Components that you drag from the <span id="more-885"></span>Component Toolbar to the Project you’re working on. These components connect to each other by wires and there is no limit for how many components that you can create and connect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/What-is-loadUI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886" title="What is loadUI" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/What-is-loadUI.jpg" alt="What is loadUI" width="400" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>This way of drag-and-drop testing is especially useful during the test, since you can do complex load tests. The overview that you get makes it easier to try different combinations during the actual test and react to them immediately. In loadUI, Instant feedback is king.</p>
<h3>Creating load tests in loadUI:</h3>
<p>In order to run a test in loadUI you need at least two components (and an empty Project to work in);</p>
<p><strong>- A generator</strong><br />
Which creates load, for example 100 requests per second.<br />
<strong>- A Runner</strong><br />
That runs a certain type of test, for example a web test.</p>
<p>So let’s do it; drag out a <em>Fixed Rate Generator</em> and a <em>Web Page Runner.</em><br />
You can’t run them yet though first you need to connect them. You do this by connecting the nodes, or <em>terminals</em>, located above and below the components to each other with <em>connections</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-components.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" title="LoadUI components" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-components.jpg" alt="LoadUI components" width="320" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>So now connect the <em>Fixed Rate Generator</em> to the <em>Web Page Runner</em>.</p>
<p>Now that everything is connected you should enter what website you want to load test into the <em>Web Page Runner</em>. Your test is now ready to run! Click the <em>play button</em> in the top menu to make your generator start sending requests to your site.</p>
<p>You can now follow, in real-time, how the test is going by clicking the <em>Results Workbench</em> button. Once there, double click on your <em>Current Run</em> and, from the left hand menu, drag out <em>Response Time </em>to the rack.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-result.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-888" title="LoadUI result" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-result.jpg" alt="LoadUI result" width="250" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>Congratulations! You have now created your first load test in loadUI. Play around with the widgets you have on your dashboard, experiment by adding some more, and try tracking other values in the Results Workbench. A good next step would to add an <em>Assertion</em> component and connecting it to the Web Page Runner. Then you can, for example, test how many times you your requests come through while following certain rules you set up (like taking less than 10 milliseconds).</p>
<h3>Pro Tips:</h3>
<p><strong>Let a manager test!</strong><br />
This is the modern way of gorilla testing.  Let someone less proficient do the testing for you and see what breaks your service. It will also create an understanding and passion for testing within the management. A usual comment is “This is fun! But hard…”</p>
<p><strong>It’s interactive, use it!</strong><br />
LoadUI is highly interactive and configurable in <strong>real-time</strong>, so take advantage of that.</p>
<p>Create a second test in real time against the same server with a different Generator and see if the system shows weaknesses when exposes to chaotic, life-like, behavior. Change this in real time and experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Record your tests</strong><br />
Since loadUI is so interactive, reproducing the tests can be difficult. Use a screen recorder like Wink (which is free) to be able to replay your tests and see what caused the service to crash.</p>
<p><strong>Work structured</strong><br />
LoadUI has support for test cases. Break up your tests into smaller test cases; you can always start them all at once.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t double-work</strong><br />
If you have created <em>functional</em> <em>tests</em> in soapUI, you can simply run these in loadUI with the <em>soapUI component</em>. This way you don’t have to redefine the test another time in loadUI.</p>
<p><strong>Write your own component</strong><br />
LoadUI is not only free; it’s open-source, too. That means that you can write your own components, in Groovy, if you wish. Only you set the limits for what is possible in LoadUI!

<em>This is a guest article by Henrik Olsson.</em><br />
<em><strong>About Author:</strong></em><br />
Henrik is a software developer for loadUI from Stockholm, Sweden with an academic background in Distributed Systems and a passion for usability. He is experienced in teaching and thinks that most things can be easily explained, if well modeled and accurately targeted.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong><br />
I&#8217;m glad to share this open source load testing tool with my readers. LoadUI and soapUI are the best open source software testing tools from trusted company eviware (now SmartBear). If you are thinking to introduce load testing tool on your project try loadUI and <a title="functional testing tool" href="http://www.soapui.org/" target="_blank">soapUI</a> (functional testing tool).  Also I personally used soapUI  for many projects and will soon cover it in a separate article. I love the power and beauty of these open source tools!</p>
<p><em><strong>If you used this tool and have some tips to share, please do it in below comment section. Also we would be happy to hear and answer your queries on loadUI.</strong></em></p>

<strong><a title="What is LoadUI" href="http://loadui.org/About-loadUI/what-is-loadui.html" target="_blank">LoadUI</a> is a free and open source load testing tool that allows you to do complex load tests and test the performance by simply dragging the different components around. </strong>LoadUI lets you to create and update test cases while you run them. What is making loadUI powerful is the focus on usability through its visual interface and intuitive design combined with the flexibility that comes from the possibility of making changes during the test.</p>
<h3>How loadUI works:</h3>
<p>LoadUI consist of building blocks called Components that you drag from the <span id="more-885"></span>Component Toolbar to the Project you’re working on. These components connect to each other by wires and there is no limit for how many components that you can create and connect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/What-is-loadUI.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886" title="What is loadUI" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/What-is-loadUI.jpg" alt="What is loadUI" width="400" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>This way of drag-and-drop testing is especially useful during the test, since you can do complex load tests. The overview that you get makes it easier to try different combinations during the actual test and react to them immediately. In loadUI, Instant feedback is king.</p>
<h3>Creating load tests in loadUI:</h3>
<p>In order to run a test in loadUI you need at least two components (and an empty Project to work in);</p>
<p><strong>- A generator</strong><br />
Which creates load, for example 100 requests per second.<br />
<strong>- A Runner</strong><br />
That runs a certain type of test, for example a web test.</p>
<p>So let’s do it; drag out a <em>Fixed Rate Generator</em> and a <em>Web Page Runner.</em><br />
You can’t run them yet though first you need to connect them. You do this by connecting the nodes, or <em>terminals</em>, located above and below the components to each other with <em>connections</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-components.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-887" title="LoadUI components" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-components.jpg" alt="LoadUI components" width="320" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>So now connect the <em>Fixed Rate Generator</em> to the <em>Web Page Runner</em>.</p>
<p>Now that everything is connected you should enter what website you want to load test into the <em>Web Page Runner</em>. Your test is now ready to run! Click the <em>play button</em> in the top menu to make your generator start sending requests to your site.</p>
<p>You can now follow, in real-time, how the test is going by clicking the <em>Results Workbench</em> button. Once there, double click on your <em>Current Run</em> and, from the left hand menu, drag out <em>Response Time </em>to the rack.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-result.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-888" title="LoadUI result" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/10/LoadUI-result.jpg" alt="LoadUI result" width="250" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>Congratulations! You have now created your first load test in loadUI. Play around with the widgets you have on your dashboard, experiment by adding some more, and try tracking other values in the Results Workbench. A good next step would to add an <em>Assertion</em> component and connecting it to the Web Page Runner. Then you can, for example, test how many times you your requests come through while following certain rules you set up (like taking less than 10 milliseconds).</p>
<h3>Pro Tips:</h3>
<p><strong>Let a manager test!</strong><br />
This is the modern way of gorilla testing.  Let someone less proficient do the testing for you and see what breaks your service. It will also create an understanding and passion for testing within the management. A usual comment is “This is fun! But hard…”</p>
<p><strong>It’s interactive, use it!</strong><br />
LoadUI is highly interactive and configurable in <strong>real-time</strong>, so take advantage of that.</p>
<p>Create a second test in real time against the same server with a different Generator and see if the system shows weaknesses when exposes to chaotic, life-like, behavior. Change this in real time and experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Record your tests</strong><br />
Since loadUI is so interactive, reproducing the tests can be difficult. Use a screen recorder like Wink (which is free) to be able to replay your tests and see what caused the service to crash.</p>
<p><strong>Work structured</strong><br />
LoadUI has support for test cases. Break up your tests into smaller test cases; you can always start them all at once.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t double-work</strong><br />
If you have created <em>functional</em> <em>tests</em> in soapUI, you can simply run these in loadUI with the <em>soapUI component</em>. This way you don’t have to redefine the test another time in loadUI.</p>
<p><strong>Write your own component</strong><br />
LoadUI is not only free; it’s open-source, too. That means that you can write your own components, in Groovy, if you wish. Only you set the limits for what is possible in LoadUI!

Henrik is a software developer for loadUI from Stockholm, Sweden with an academic background in Distributed Systems and a passion for usability. He is experienced in teaching and thinks that most things can be easily explained, if well modeled and accurately targeted.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong><br />
I&#8217;m glad to share this open source load testing tool with my readers. LoadUI and soapUI are the best open source software testing tools from trusted company eviware (now SmartBear). If you are thinking to introduce load testing tool on your project try loadUI and <a title="functional testing tool" href="http://www.soapui.org/" target="_blank">soapUI</a> (functional testing tool).  Also I personally used soapUI  for many projects and will soon cover it in a separate article. I love the power and beauty of these open source tools!</p>

<p>&#8220;If QA (Quality Assurance) is done then why do we need to perform QC (Quality Control)?&#8221;, this thought may come to our mind some times and looks a valid point too.  This means if we have followed all the pre-defined processes, policies and standards correctly and completely then why do we need to perform a round of QC?</p>
<p><strong>In my opinion QC is required after QA is done.</strong> While in ‘QA’ we define the processes, policies, strategies, establish standards, developing checklists etc. to be used and followed through out the life cycle of a project. And while in QC we follow all those defined processes, standards and policies to make sure <span id="more-875"></span>that the project has been developed with high quality and at least meets customer’s expectations.</p>
<p><strong>QA does not assure quality, rather it creates and ensures the processes are being followed to assure quality. QC does not control quality, rather it measures quality.</strong> QC measurement results can be utilized to correct/modify QA processes which can be successfully implemented in new projects as well.</p>
<p>Quality control activities are focused on the deliverable itself. Quality assurance activities are focused on the processes used to create the deliverable.<strong> QA and QC are both powerful techniques which can be used to ensure that the deliverables meet high quality expectations of customers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>E.g.:</strong> we have to use an Issue tracking system to log the bugs during testing a web application. QA would include defining the standard for adding a bug and what all details should be there in a bug, like summary of the issue, where it is observed, steps to reproduce the bugs, screenshots etc. This is a process to create deliverable ‘bug–report’. When a bug is actually added in issue tracking system based on these standards then that bug report is our deliverable.</p>
<p>Now, suppose some time at later stage of project we realize that adding ‘probable root cause’ to the bug based on tester’s analysis would provide some more insight to the Dev team, then we will update our pre-defined process and finally it will be reflected in our bug reports as well. This is how QC gives inputs to QA to further improve the QA.</p>
<p><strong>Following is an example of a real life scenario for QA / QC:</strong></p>
<p><strong>QA Example:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/09/Quality-Assurance.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-877 alignnone" title="Quality Assurance" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/09/Quality-Assurance.jpg" alt="Quality Assurance" width="220" height="220" /></a></p>
<p>Suppose our team has to work on completely new technology for upcoming project. Our team members are new to the technology. So for that we need to create a plan for training the team members in the new technology. Based on our knowledge we need to collect pre-requisites like understanding documents, design of the product along with the documents etc. and share with the team, which would be helpful while working on the new technology and even would be useful for any new comer in the team. This is QA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QC Example:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/09/Quality-Control.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-876 alignnone" title="Quality Control" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/09/Quality-Control.png" alt="Quality Control" width="232" height="209" /></a></p>
<p>Once the training is done how we can make sure that the training was successfully done for all the team members? For this purpose we will have to collect statistics e.g. number of marks the trainees got in each subject and minimum number of marks expected after completing the training. Also we can make sure that everybody has taken training in full by verifying the attendance record of candidates. If the number of marks of candidates are up to the expectations of the trainer/evaluators then we can say that the training is successful otherwise we will have to improve our process in order to deliver high quality training.</p>
<p>Hope this explains the difference between QA and QC.</p>

<p>Software industry has achieved a solid recognition in this age. In the recent decade, however, cyber-world seems to be even more dominating and driving force which is shaping up the new forms of almost every business. Web based ERP systems used today are the best evidence that IT has revolutionized our beloved global village.</p>
<p>These days, websites are not meant only for publicity or marketing but these have been evolved into the stronger tools to cater complete business needs. Web based Payroll systems, Shopping Malls, Banking, Stock Trade application are not only being used by organizations but are also being sold as products today.</p>
<p>This means that online applications have gained the trust of customers and <span id="more-870"></span>users regarding their vital feature named as SECURITY. No doubt, the security factor is of primary value for desktop applications too. However, when we talk about web, importance of security increases exponentially. If an online system cannot protect the transaction data, no one will ever think of using it. Security is neither a word in search of its definition yet, nor is it a subtle concept. However, I would like to list some complements of security.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/09/Security-Testing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-871" title="Security Testing" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/09/Security-Testing-300x225.jpg" alt="Security Testing" width="333" height="250" /></a></p>
<h3>Examples of security flaws in an application:</h3>
<p><strong>1)</strong> A Student Management System is insecure if ‘Admission’ branch can edit the data of ‘Exam’ branch<br />
<strong>2)</strong> An ERP system is not secure if DEO (data entry operator) can generate ‘Reports’<br />
<strong>3)</strong> An online Shopping Mall has no security if customer’s Credit Card Detail is not encrypted<br />
<strong>4)</strong> A custom software possess inadequate security if an SQL query retrieves actual passwords of its users</p>
<p><strong>Security Testing Definition:</strong><br />
Now, I present you a <strong>simplest definition of Security</strong> in my own words. <strong><em>“Security means that authorized access is granted to protected data and unauthorized access is restricted”</em>.</strong> So, it has two major aspects; first is protection of data and second one is access to that data. Moreover, whether the application is desktop or web based, security revolves around the two aforementioned aspects. Let us have an overview of security aspects for both desktop and web based software applications.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop and Web Security Testing:</strong><br />
A desktop application should be secure not only regarding its access but also with respect to organization and storage of its data. Similarly, a web application demands even more security with respect to its access, along with data protection. Web developer should make the application immune to SQL Injections, Brute Force Attacks and XSS (cross site scripting). Similarly, if the web application facilitates remote access points then these must be secure too. Moreover, keep in mind that Brute Force Attack is not only related to web applications, desktop software is also vulnerable to this.</p>
<p>I hope this foreword is enough and now let me come to the point. Kindly accept my apology if you so far thought that you are reading about the subject of this article. Though I have briefly explained software Security and its major concerns, but my topic is ‘Security Testing’. In order to know further details of security aspects, kindly refer to &#8211; <a title="Web application security testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/security-testing-of-web-applications/"><strong>Web application security testing</strong></a> article.</p>
<p>I will now explain how the features of security are implemented in software application and how should these be tested. My focus will be on Whats and Hows of security testing, not of security.</p>
<h3>Security Testing Techniques:</h3>
<h3>1) Access to Application:<strong></strong></h3>
<p>Whether it is a desktop application of website, access security is implemented by <strong>‘Roles and Rights Management’.</strong> It is often done implicitly while covering functionality, e.g.in a Hospital Management System a receptionist is least concerned about the laboratory tests as his job is to just register the patients and schedule their appointments with doctors. So, all the menus, forms and screen related to lab tests will not be available to the Role of ‘Receptionist’. Hence, the proper implementation of roles and rights will guarantee the security of access.</p>
<p><strong>How to Test:</strong> In order to test this, thorough testing of all roles and rights should be performed. Tester should create several user accounts with different as well multiple roles. Then he should use the application with the help of these accounts and should verify that every role has access to its own modules, screens, forms and menus only. If tester finds any conflict, he should log a security issue with complete confidence.</p>
<h3>2. Data Protection:</h3>
<p>There are further three aspects of data security. First one is that <strong>a user can view or utilize only the data which he is supposed to use</strong>. This is also ensured by roles and rights e.g. a TSR (telesales representative) of a company can view the data of available stock, but cannot see how much raw material was purchased for production.</p>
<p>So, testing of this aspect is already explained above. The second aspect of data protection is related to <strong>how that data is stored in the DB</strong>. All the sensitive data must be encrypted to make it secure. Encryption should be strong especially for sensitive data like passwords of user accounts, credit card numbers or other business critical information. Third and last aspect is extension of this second aspect. Proper security measures must be adopted when flow of sensitive or business critical data occurs. Whether this data floats between different modules of same application, or is transmitted to different applications it must be encrypted to make it safe.</p>
<p><strong>How to Test Data Protection:</strong> The tester should query the database for ‘passwords’ of user account, billing information of clients, other business critical and sensitive data and should verify that all such data is saved in encrypted form in the DB. Similarly (s)he must verify that between different forms or screens, data is transmitted after proper encryption. Moreover, tester should ensure that the encrypted data is properly decrypted at the destination. Special attention should be paid on different ‘submit’ actions. The tester must verify that when the information is being transmitted between client and server, it is not displayed in the address bar of web browser in understandable format. If any of these verifications fail, the application definitely has security flaw.</p>
<h3>3. Brute-Force Attack:</h3>
<p>Brute Force Attack is mostly done by some software tools. The concept is that using a valid user ID, s<strong>oftware attempts to guess the associated password by trying to login again and again.</strong> A simple example of security against such attack is account suspension for a short period of time as all the mailing applications like ‘Yahoo’ and ‘Hotmail’ do. If, a specific number of consecutive attempts (mostly 3) fail to login successfully, then that account is blocked for some time (30 minutes to 24 hrs).</p>
<p><strong>How to test Brute-Force Attack:</strong> The tester must verify that some mechanism of account suspension is available and is working accurately. (S)He must attempt to login with invalid user IDs and Passwords alternatively to make sure that software application blocks the accounts that continuously attempt login with invalid information. If the application is doing so, it is secure against brute-force attack. Otherwise, this security vulnerability must be reported by the tester.</p>
<p><strong>The above three security aspects should be taken into account for both web and desktop applications while, the following points are related with web based applications only.</strong></p>
<h3>4. <a title="Web application security testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/sql-injection-%E2%80%93-how-to-test-application-for-sql-injection-attacks/">SQL Injection</a> and XSS (cross site scripting):</h3>
<p>Conceptually speaking, the theme of both these hacking attempts is similar, so these are discussed together. In this approach, <strong>malicious script is used by the hackers in order to manipulate a website</strong>. There are several ways to immune against such attempts. For all input fields of the website, field lengths should be defined small enough to restrict input of any script e.g. Last Name should have field length 30 instead of 255. There may be some input fields where large data input is necessary, for such fields proper validation of input should be performed prior to saving that data in the application. Moreover, in such fields any html tags or script tag input must be prohibited. In order to provoke XSS attacks, the application should discard script redirects from unknown or untrusted applications.</p>
<p><strong>How to test SQL Injection and XSS:</strong> Tester must ensure that maximum lengths of all input fields are defined and implemented. (S)He should also ensure that defined length of input fields does not accommodate any script input as well as tag input. Both these can be easily tested e.g. if 20 is the maximum length specified for ‘Name’ field; and input string “&lt;p&gt;thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog” can verify both these constraints. It should also be verified by the tester that application does not support anonymous access methods. In case any of these vulnerabilities exists, the application is in danger.</p>
<h3>5. Service Access Points (Sealed and Secure Open)</h3>
<p>Today, businesses depend and collaborate with each other, same holds good for applications especially websites. In such case, both the collaborators should define and publish some access points for each other. So far the scenario seems quite simple and straightforward but, for some web based product like stock trading, things are not so simple and easy. When there is large number of target audience, the access points should be open enough to facilitate all users, accommodating enough to fulfill all users’ requests and secure enough to cope with any security-trial.</p>
<p><strong>How to Test Service Access Points:</strong> Let me explain it with the example of stock trading web application; an investor (who wants to purchase the shares) should have access to current and historical data of stock prices. User should be given the facility to download this historical data. This demands that application should be open enough. By accommodating and secure, I mean that application should facilitate investors to trade freely (under the legislative regulations). They may purchase or sale 24/7 and the data of transactions must be immune to any hacking attack. Moreover, a large number of users will be interacting with application simultaneously, so the application should provide enough number access point to entertain all the users.</p>
<p>In some cases these <strong>access points can be sealed for unwanted applications or people</strong>. This depends upon the business domain of application and its users, e.g. a custom web based Office Management System may recognize its users on the basis of IP Addresses and denies to establish a connection with all other systems (applications) that do not lie in the range of valid IPs for that application.</p>
<p>Tester must ensure that all the<strong> inter-network and intra-network access</strong> to the application is from trusted applications, machines (IPs) and users. In order to verify that an open access point is secure enough, tester must try to access it from different machines having both trusted and untrusted IP addresses. Different sort of real-time transactions should be tried in a bulk to have a good confidence of application’s performance.  By doing so, the capacity of access points of the application will also be observed clearly.</p>
<p>Tester must ensure that the application entertains all the communication requests from trusted IPs and applications only while all the other request are rejected. Similarly, if the application has some open access point, then tester should ensure that it allows (if required) uploading of data by users in secure way. By this secure way I mean, the file size limit, file type restriction and scanning of uploaded file for viruses or other security threats. This is all how a tester can verify the security of an application with respect to its access points.</p>

<h3>4. <a title="Web application security testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/sql-injection-%E2%80%93-how-to-test-application-for-sql-injection-attacks/">SQL Injection</a> and XSS (cross site scripting):</h3>

It should also be verified by the tester that application does not support anonymous access methods. In case any of these vulnerabilities exists, the application is in danger.</p>
<h3>5. Service Access Points (Sealed and Secure Open)</h3>
<p>Today, businesses depend and collaborate with each other, same holds good for applications especially websites. In such case, both the collaborators should define and publish some access points for each other. So far the scenario seems quite simple and straightforward but, for some web based product like stock trading, things are not so simple and easy. When there is large number of target audience, the access points should be open enough to facilitate all users, accommodating enough to fulfill all users’ requests and secure enough to cope with any security-trial.</p>
<p><strong>How to Test Service Access Points:</strong> Let me explain it with the example of stock trading web application; an investor (who wants to purchase the shares) should have access to current and historical data of stock prices. User should be given the facility to download this historical data. This demands that application should be open enough. By accommodating and secure, I mean that application should facilitate investors to trade freely (under the legislative regulations). They may purchase or sale 24/7 and the data of transactions must be immune to any hacking attack. Moreover, a large number of users will be interacting with application simultaneously, so the application should provide enough number access point to entertain all the users.</p>
<p>In some cases these <strong>access points can be sealed for unwanted applications or people</strong>. This depends upon the business domain of application and its users, e.g. a custom web based Office Management System may recognize its users on the basis of IP Addresses and denies to establish a connection with all other systems (applications) that do not lie in the range of valid IPs for that application.</p>
<p>Tester must ensure that all the<strong> inter-network and intra-network access</strong> to the application is from trusted applications, machines (IPs) and users. In order to verify that an open access point is secure enough, tester must try to access it from different machines having both trusted and untrusted IP addresses. Different sort of real-time transactions should be tried in a bulk to have a good confidence of application’s performance.  By doing so, the capacity of access points of the application will also be observed clearly.</p>
<p>Tester must ensure that the application entertains all the communication requests from trusted IPs and applications only while all the other request are rejected. Similarly, if the application has some open access point, then tester should ensure that it allows (if required) uploading of data by users in secure way. By this secure way I mean, the file size limit, file type restriction and scanning of uploaded file for viruses or other security threats. This is all how a tester can verify the security of an application with respect to its access points.</p>

- Application Testing – Best Practices</p>
<p>Application Testing is an activity that every software tester performs daily in his career. These two words are extremely broad in practical aspect. However, only the core and most important areas will be discussed here. The purpose of this article is to touch all the primary areas so that the readers will get all the basic briefing at a single place.</p>
<h3>Categories of Applications</h3>
<p>Whether it is small calculator software with only the basic arithmetic <span id="more-852"></span>operations, or an online enterprise solution; there are two categories of applications.<br />
<strong>a. <a title="Difference between Desktop, Client server and Web testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/difference-between-desktop-client-server-and-web-testing/">Desktop</a></strong><br />
<strong>b. <a title="Web testing complete guide" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/web-application-testing/">Web</a></strong></p>
<p>For desktop applications, testing should take into account the UI, business logic, database, reports, roles and rights, integrity, usability and data flow. For web applications, along with all these major areas; testers should give sufficient importance to performance, load and security of the application. So AUT is either desktop software or a website.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/08/Application-Testing.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-856 alignnone" title="Application Testing" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/08/Application-Testing.jpg" alt="Application Testing" width="244" height="148" /></a></h3>
<h3>Application Testing Methodologies</h3>
<p>This is a well-known and well discussed aspect; there are only 3 universally accepted methodologies;</p>
<p><strong>a. <a title="Black box testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/black-box-testing/">Black Box</a>:</strong> In black-box testing, the AUT is validated against its requirements considering the inputs and expected outputs, regardless of how the inputs are transformed into outputs. Testers are least concerned with internal structure or code that implements the business logic of the application. There are four primary techniques to design test cases for black box testing;</p>
<p>i. BVA (<a title="Boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/what-is-boundary-value-analysis-and-equivalence-partitioning/">Boundary value Analysis</a>)<br />
ii. EP (Equivalence Partitioning)<br />
iii. Decision Tables<br />
iv. State Transition Tables (and diagrams)</p>
<p><strong>a. <a title="White box testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/white-box-testing/">White Box</a>:</strong> Primary focus of this methodology is to validate, how the business logic of application is implemented by code. Internal structure of the application is tested and the techniques available to do so are;</p>
<p>i. <a title="Maximum code coverage" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/practical-approaches-to-improving-your-testing-by-maximizing-code-coverage/">Code Coverage</a><br />
ii. Path Coverage</p>
<p>Both the above listed techniques contain several other strategies that may be discussed in some other article. Some techniques are discussed in ‘<a title="Writing effective test cases" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-write-effective-test-cases-test-cases-procedures-and-definitions/">Test Case Design Techniques</a>’ topic.</p>
<p><strong>a. Grey Box: </strong>Practically speaking, this is a mixture of black box and white box. In this methodology, mainly the tester tests the application as in black box. But, for some business critical or vulnerable modules of application; testing is done as white box.</p>
<h3>Application <a title="Software testing tools" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/category/software-testing-tools/">Testing Tools</a></h3>
<p>According to the best of my knowledge, there are at least 50 testing tools available in market today. These include both paid and open source tools. Moreover, some tools are purpose specific e.g. UI testing, Functional Testing, DB Testing, Load Testing, Performance, Security Testing and Link validation testing etc. However, some tools are strong and provide the facility of testing several major aspects of an application. The general concept of &#8216;Application Testing&#8217; is its functional testing. So, our focus will be on functional testing tools.</p>
<p>Here is the list of some most important and fundamental features that are provided by almost all of the &#8216;Functional Testing&#8217; tools.</p>
<p>a. Record and Play<br />
b. Parametrize the Values<br />
c. Script Editor<br />
d. Run (the test or script, with debug and update modes)<br />
c. Report of Run session</p>
<p>Different vendors provide some specific features that make their product unique to other competitor products. But the five features listed above are the most common and can be found in almost all the functional testing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Following is the list of few widely used Functional Testing tools.</strong></p>
<p>1) HP QTP (<a title="QTP review" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/qtp-functional-testing-tool-review/">Quick Test Professional</a>)<br />
2) Selenium<br />
3) <a title="Learning Rational Robot" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/learning-basics-of-rational-robot-ibm-test-automation-tool/">IBM Rational Robot</a><br />
4) Test Complete<br />
5) Push to Test<br />
6) Telerik</p>
<h3><a title="Test Plan sample" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/test-plan-sample-softwaretesting-and-quality-assurance-templates/">Software Test Plan</a> (STP)</h3>
<p>For any activity, some planning is always required and same is true for software testing. Without proper plan there is always high risk of getting distracted during the testing. If this risk becomes a fact, the results could be horrible.</p>
<p><strong>Following are the 5 main parts of a good Test Plan:</strong><br />
<strong>a. Scope</strong><br />
i. Overview of AUT<br />
ii. Features (or areas) to be tested<br />
iii. Exclusions (features or areas not to be tested) with reason<br />
iv. Dependencies (of testing activities on each other, if any)</p>
<p><strong>b. Objectives:</strong> This section describes the goals of testing activity e.g. validation of bug fixes, new features added or revamp of AUT etc.</p>
<p><strong>c. Focus:</strong> This section describes what aspect of application will be included in the testing e.g. security, functionality, usability, reliability, performance or efficiency etc.</p>
<p><strong>d. Approach:</strong> This section describes what testing methodology will be adopted for which areas of AUT. For example, in the STP of an ERP application; the approach section may contain the information that black box testing will be approach for payroll. On the other hand, for reports the approach will be grey box testing.</p>
<p><strong>e. Schedule:</strong> This sections describes that who will be doing what and where on the AUT, when and how. Schedule section is, in fact, a &#8217;4Ws and H&#8217; of the STP. Normally it is a simple table, but every organization may have its own customized format according to their own needs. Once the test plan is ready and application is under development; testers design and document the test cases. In the &#8220;Application Testing &#8211; Methodologies&#8221; section above, I have listed the TC design techniques.</p>
<h3><a title="Testing life cycle" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/category/testing-life-cycle/">Application Testing Cycles</a></h3>
<p>Once the AUT is ready for testing, the practical phase of testing cycle starts in which testers actually execute the test cases on AUT. Keep in mind that here the testing cycle is discussed regardless of Testing Levels (Unit, Module, Integration, System and User Acceptance) and Testing Environments (Dev, QA, Client&#8217;s Replica, Live).</p>
<p><strong>a. <a title="Smoke and Sanity testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/smoke-testing-and-sanity-testing-difference/">Smoke Testing</a>:</strong> The very first testing cycle that is wide and shallow in approach. The purpose of smoke testing is to verify that there are no crashes in the application and it is suitable for further testing.</p>
<p><strong>b. Sanity Testing:</strong> The second testing cycle that is narrow and deep in its approach. Its purpose is to verify that a specific module is working properly and is suitable for complete testing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip:</span> Usually there is not ample amount of time available to run these two cycles separately. So, a mixture of both these cycles is adopted in practical.</p>
<p><strong>c. Functional Testing:</strong> The proper and full fledged testing of application is performed in this cycle. The primary focus of this activity is to verify the business logic of the application.</p>
<p><strong>d. <a title="Regression testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/regression-testing-tools-and-methods/">Regression Testing</a>:</strong> This is the final cycle of testing in which the bug-fixes and/or updates are verified. Moreover, regression testing also ensures that there is no malfunctioning in other areas of AUT due to fixes and changes.</p>
<p>Bugs are logged in every testing cycle. There is no distinct border line between the testing cycles. For example, in Regression the Functionality is also verified and it may also require smoke, sanity or their merger first.</p>
<h3>Application Testing – <a title="Software testing best practices" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/category/testing-best-practices/">Best Practices</a></h3>
<p>I think, hundreds of articles are available about this on internet. Every article suggests different number of best practices ranging from 7 to 30 (that I have seen so far). However, I have just 5 tips for readers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan <em>Properly</em></li>
<li>Test <em>Keenly</em></li>
<li><em></em>Log the bugs <em>Clearly</em></li>
<li>Do Regression Test <em>Efficiently</em></li>
<li>Improve above four skills <em>Continuously</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Application Testing is a vast subject and the primary activity of any software tester. In this article, I have provided the overview of some most fundamental and necessary areas that fall under this topic. Application Testing involves strategies, phenomena, approaches, tools, technologies and guidelines. However, I have addressed the conceptual and practical insight of its salient concerns.</p>

iv. State Transition Tables (and diagrams)</p>
<p><strong>a. <a title="White box testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/white-box-testing/">White Box</a>:</strong> Primary focus of this methodology is to validate, how the business logic of application is implemented by code. Internal structure of the application is tested and the techniques available to do so are;</p>
<p>i. <a title="Maximum code coverage" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/practical-approaches-to-improving-your-testing-by-maximizing-code-coverage/">Code Coverage</a><br />
ii. Path Coverage</p>
<p>Both the above listed techniques contain several other strategies that may be discussed in some other article. Some techniques are discussed in ‘<a title="Writing effective test cases" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-write-effective-test-cases-test-cases-procedures-and-definitions/">Test Case Design Techniques</a>’ topic.</p>
<p><strong>a. Grey Box: </strong>Practically speaking, this is a mixture of black box and white box. In this methodology, mainly the tester tests the application as in black box. But, for some business critical or vulnerable modules of application; testing is done as white box.</p>
<h3>Application <a title="Software testing tools" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/category/software-testing-tools/">Testing Tools</a></h3>
<p>According to the best of my knowledge, there are at least 50 testing tools available in market today. These include both paid and open source tools. Moreover, some tools are purpose specific e.g. UI testing, Functional Testing, DB Testing, Load Testing, Performance, Security Testing and Link validation testing etc. However, some tools are strong and provide the facility of testing several major aspects of an application. The general concept of &#8216;Application Testing&#8217; is its functional testing. So, our focus will be on functional testing tools.</p>
<p>Here is the list of some most important and fundamental features that are provided by almost all of the &#8216;Functional Testing&#8217; tools.</p>
<p>a. Record and Play<br />
b. Parametrize the Values<br />
c. Script Editor<br />
d. Run (the test or script, with debug and update modes)<br />
c. Report of Run session</p>
<p>Different vendors provide some specific features that make their product unique to other competitor products. But the five features listed above are the most common and can be found in almost all the functional testing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Following is the list of few widely used Functional Testing tools.</strong></p>
<p>1) HP QTP (<a title="QTP review" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/qtp-functional-testing-tool-review/">Quick Test Professional</a>)<br />
2) Selenium<br />
3) <a title="Learning Rational Robot" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/learning-basics-of-rational-robot-ibm-test-automation-tool/">IBM Rational Robot</a><br />
4) Test Complete<br />
5) Push to Test<br />
6) Telerik</p>
<h3><a title="Test Plan sample" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/test-plan-sample-softwaretesting-and-quality-assurance-templates/">Software Test Plan</a> (STP)</h3>
<p>For any activity, some planning is always required and same is true for software testing. Without proper plan there is always high risk of getting distracted during the testing. If this risk becomes a fact, the results could be horrible.</p>
<p><strong>Following are the 5 main parts of a good Test Plan:</strong><br />
<strong>a. Scope</strong><br />
i. Overview of AUT<br />
ii. Features (or areas) to be tested<br />
iii. Exclusions (features or areas not to be tested) with reason<br />
iv. Dependencies (of testing activities on each other, if any)</p>
<p><strong>b. Objectives:</strong> This section describes the goals of testing activity e.g. validation of bug fixes, new features added or revamp of AUT etc.</p>
<p><strong>c. Focus:</strong> This section describes what aspect of application will be included in the testing e.g. security, functionality, usability, reliability, performance or efficiency etc.</p>
<p><strong>d. Approach:</strong> This section describes what testing methodology will be adopted for which areas of AUT. For example, in the STP of an ERP application; the approach section may contain the information that black box testing will be approach for payroll. On the other hand, for reports the approach will be grey box testing.</p>
<p><strong>e. Schedule:</strong> This sections describes that who will be doing what and where on the AUT, when and how. Schedule section is, in fact, a &#8217;4Ws and H&#8217; of the STP. Normally it is a simple table, but every organization may have its own customized format according to their own needs. Once the test plan is ready and application is under development; testers design and document the test cases. In the &#8220;Application Testing &#8211; Methodologies&#8221; section above, I have listed the TC design techniques.</p>
<h3><a title="Testing life cycle" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/category/testing-life-cycle/">Application Testing Cycles</a></h3>
<p>Once the AUT is ready for testing, the practical phase of testing cycle starts in which testers actually execute the test cases on AUT. Keep in mind that here the testing cycle is discussed regardless of Testing Levels (Unit, Module, Integration, System and User Acceptance) and Testing Environments (Dev, QA, Client&#8217;s Replica, Live).</p>
<p><strong>a. <a title="Smoke and Sanity testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/smoke-testing-and-sanity-testing-difference/">Smoke Testing</a>:</strong> The very first testing cycle that is wide and shallow in approach. The purpose of smoke testing is to verify that there are no crashes in the application and it is suitable for further testing.</p>
<p><strong>b. Sanity Testing:</strong> The second testing cycle that is narrow and deep in its approach. Its purpose is to verify that a specific module is working properly and is suitable for complete testing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip:</span> Usually there is not ample amount of time available to run these two cycles separately. So, a mixture of both these cycles is adopted in practical.</p>
<p><strong>c. Functional Testing:</strong> The proper and full fledged testing of application is performed in this cycle. The primary focus of this activity is to verify the business logic of the application.</p>
<p><strong>d. <a title="Regression testing" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/regression-testing-tools-and-methods/">Regression Testing</a>:</strong> This is the final cycle of testing in which the bug-fixes and/or updates are verified. Moreover, regression testing also ensures that there is no malfunctioning in other areas of AUT due to fixes and changes.</p>
<p>Bugs are logged in every testing cycle. There is no distinct border line between the testing cycles. For example, in Regression the Functionality is also verified and it may also require smoke, sanity or their merger first.</p>
<h3>Application Testing – <a title="Software testing best practices" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/category/testing-best-practices/">Best Practices</a></h3>
<p>I think, hundreds of articles are available about this on internet. Every article suggests different number of best practices ranging from 7 to 30 (that I have seen so far). However, I have just 5 tips for readers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan <em>Properly</em></li>
<li>Test <em>Keenly</em></li>
<li><em></em>Log the bugs <em>Clearly</em></li>
<li>Do Regression Test <em>Efficiently</em></li>
<li>Improve above four skills <em>Continuously</em></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Application Testing is a vast subject and the primary activity of any software tester. In this article, I have provided the overview of some most fundamental and necessary areas that fall under this topic. Application Testing involves strategies, phenomena, approaches, tools, technologies and guidelines. However, I have addressed the conceptual and practical insight of its salient concerns.</p>

<p><strong>GUI testing can be toughest part especially while testing on smart device.</strong> You should pay full attention to the GUI while testing on smart devices and surely it is an important task that deserves significant time and resource allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Practical <a title="Practical testing tips" href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/practical-software-testing-tips-to-test-any-application/">Tips for Testing</a> GUI on Smart Devices:<br />
</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-846"></span>For me, while testing GUI, all the controls are accused. <strong>I raise questions why they are there on the screen and I try to answer these questions.</strong> I argue in opposition and favor of the controls one by one and I do all this without discussing with someone else. It is the time when I’m wearing multiple hats, Controls are accused and I’m the Prosecutor , I’m the Defense Lawyer and I’m the Judge and during all this process a control must have valid and solid reasons in its favor to be there on screen and consume space. I suggest you to try it and it will help you to decide which controls to display on the screen.</p>
<p>There also come the situations where you are given an already built GUI to test. In such situations also <strong>think about the missing controls</strong>, the controls that will add value to the screen and compare their importance with the current ones. If you think you need to make a change go ahead.</p>
<p>Once you have decided which controls will be shown on the screen, think thoroughly about size, style and location of the controls on the screen and more important how user will interact with them?</p>
<p><strong>3 important factors to be considered while testing GUI on Smart Devices:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/08/GUI-testing-smart-devices.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-847 alignnone" title="GUI testing smart devices" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/08/GUI-testing-smart-devices.jpg" alt="GUI testing smart devices" width="228" height="189" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong><br />
There are too many variations in screen sizes and available resolutions. In smart devices especially, controls sizes are not static, they have relation to the available screen size.</p>
<p>While testing, make sure that controls size looks esthetically good and control is completely visible on the screen without any scrolling. Test the GUI on different devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
<p>Emulators are good for this purpose but nothing matches the real device. So make sure that you test on at least two or three real devices. Also don’t forget to test on landscape and portrait orientations if the device supports it.</p>
<p><strong>Style:</strong><br />
Definitely your application has a specific design. And style of the controls should match with that design. You might have seen many applications where some controls e.g. panels have round edges and text boxes in them have sharp edges. Although this type of issues don’t affect the usability or functionality but still a consistent look of the application helps to build a friendly relation between the application and the user.</p>
<p>Relatively more important thing in style is font on the different pages. Most of the times, we focus the text that is visible in normal situations and ignore the text that appears in specific situations. Success and Failure messages are an example of such type of text.</p>
<p>Another factor, important in style is relation between the font color and the situation in which text is displayed. For example Red color is used for Error messages, Green for success, Yellow for warnings and Blue (now a day occasionally) for hyperlinks.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong><br />
Location and position are the two words that are used alternatively and it is interesting that they are further used to convey two different concepts that are explained below.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Sometimes it is the area on the screen where a control appears. For example Header is located on <strong>Top</strong> of the page, Labels are <strong>Left Aligned</strong>, and Text boxes are <strong>Right Aligned</strong> etc. Here text in bold are relative positions of the controls</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Sometimes it is the order of a control among the other controls. For example while getting personal info, First Name is <strong>followed</strong> by the last name or format of controls to ask for a US address should be in <strong>order</strong> ZIP, City, State.</p>
<p>For both these situations, make sure that everything is logical and shows a good aesthetic sense.</p>
<p>Forgot something even more important. There are situations where one or more controls appear on more than one screen, in this situation make sure that they appear on same location and in the same order on all the pages.</p>

<h3><strong>1) Performance Testing</strong>:</h3>
<p>Performance testing is the testing, which is performed, to ascertain how the components of a system are performing, given a particular situation. Resource usage, scalability and reliability of the product are also validated under this testing. This testing is the subset of performance engineering, which is focused on addressing performance issues in the design and architecture of software product.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Testing Goal:</strong></p>
<p>The primary goal of performance testing includes establishing the benchmark behaviour of the <span id="more-833"></span>system. There are a number of industry-defined benchmarks, which should be met during performance testing.</p>
<p>Performance testing does not aim to find defects in the application, it address a little more critical task of testing the benchmark and standard set for the application. Accuracy and close monitoring of the performance and results of the test is the primary characteristic of performance testing.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>For instance, you can test the application network performance on Connection Speed vs. Latency chart. Latency is the time difference between the data to reach from source to destination. Thus, a 70kb page would take not more than 15 seconds to load for a worst connection of 28.8kbps modem (latency=1000 milliseconds), while the page of same size would appear within 5 seconds, for the average connection of 256kbps DSL (latency=100 milliseconds). 1.5mbps T1 connection (latency=50 milliseconds) would have the performance benchmark set within 1 second to achieve this target.</p>
<p>For example, the time difference between the generation of request and acknowledgement of response should be in the range of x ms (milliseconds) and y ms, where x and y are standard digits. A successful performance testing should project most of the performance issues, which could be related to database, network, software, hardware etc…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/07/Performance-Load-and-stress-testing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834" title="Performance Load and stress testing" src="http://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/wp-content/qa/uploads/2011/07/Performance-Load-and-stress-testing.jpg" alt="Performance Load and stress testing" width="399" height="244" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>2) Load Testing:</strong></h3>
<p>Load testing is meant to test the system by constantly and steadily increasing the load on the system till the time it reaches the threshold limit. It is the simplest form of testing which employs the use of automation tools such as LoadRunner or any other good tools, which are available. Load testing is also famous by the names like <strong>volume testing</strong> and <strong>endurance testing</strong>.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of load testing is to assign the system the largest job it could possible handle to test the endurance and monitoring the results. An interesting fact is that sometimes the system is fed with empty task to determine the behaviour of system in zero-load situation.</p>
<p><strong>Load Testing Goal:</strong></p>
<p>The goals of load testing are to expose the defects in application related to buffer overflow, memory leaks and mismanagement of memory. Another target of load testing is to determine the upper limit of all the components of application like database, hardware and network etc… so that it could manage the anticipated load in future. The issues that would eventually come out as the result of load testing may include load balancing problems, bandwidth issues, capacity of the existing system etc…</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>For example, to check the email functionality of an application, it could be flooded with 1000 users at a time. Now, 1000 users can fire the email transactions (read, send, delete, forward, reply) in many different ways. If we take one transaction per user per hour, then it would be 1000 transactions per hour. By simulating 10 transactions/user, we could load test the email server by occupying it with 10000 transactions/hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3) Stress testing</h3>
<p>Under stress testing, various activities to overload the existing resources with excess jobs are carried out in an attempt to break the system down. <strong>Negative testing</strong>, which includes removal of the components from the system is also done as a part of stress testing. Also known as <strong>fatigue testing</strong>, this testing should capture the stability of the application by testing it beyond its bandwidth capacity.</p>
<p>The purpose behind stress testing is to ascertain the failure of system and to monitor how the system recovers back gracefully. The challenge here is to set up a controlled environment before launching the test so that you could precisely capture the behaviour of system repeatedly, under the most unpredictable scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Stress Testing Goal:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the stress testing is to analyse post-crash reports to define the behaviour of application after failure. The biggest issue is to ensure that the system does not compromise with the security of sensitive data after the failure. In a successful stress testing, the system will come back to normality along with all its components, after even the most terrible break down.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>As an example, a word processor like Writer1.1.0 by OpenOffice.org is utilized in development of letters, presentations, spread sheets etc… Purpose of our stress testing is to load it with the excess of characters.</p>
<p>To do this, we will repeatedly paste a line of data, till it reaches its threshold limit of handling large volume of text. As soon as the character size reaches 65,535 characters, it would simply refuse to accept more data. The result of stress testing on Writer 1.1.0 produces the result that, it does not crash under the stress and that it handle the situation gracefully, which make sure that application is working correctly even under rigorous stress conditions.</p>
